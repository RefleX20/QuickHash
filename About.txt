As a senior in college. Quick hash is my first ever application developed and submitted to the MacOS app store. 
I use checksums often to verify that the file i downloaded matches the file that the developer website provides. This 
comes in handy when the developer download is not working and finding a 3rd party archive is nessesary. If the developer website
provides a Checksum in SHA-256 or other common checksums, you can verify the authenicity of the download to prove that the file
doesnt have any malicious changes to it. 



When comparing using my to generate SHA checksums versus using the command prompt, here are the key diffences:
