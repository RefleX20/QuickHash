As a senior in college, Quick Hash is my first application, which was developed and submitted to the macOS App Store. 
I often use checksums to verify that the files I download are authentic and match the ones provided by the 
developer's website. However, I grew tired of looking up the commands whenever I needed 
to generate a checksum.

The best part is that NO DATA IS COLLECTED, AND IT IS 100% FREE, unlike websites that collect your IP, 
MAC Address and other identifying information, including advertising. 

Quick Hash simplifies the process by making it easy to generate checksums for any file with just a few 
clicks. This is especially useful when the official download from a developer’s website is unavailable and
you're forced to download from a third-party archive. By comparing the checksum provided by the developer 
(like an SHA-256 hash), you can verify that malicious actors haven’t tampered with the file.

Additionally, Quick Hash can be used when sending sensitive files, such as tax documents, to ensure 
they haven’t been altered. This adds an extra layer of security when sharing important information that 
hackers might be interested in modifying.

When comparing using my to generate SHA checksums versus using the command prompt, here are the key differences:
